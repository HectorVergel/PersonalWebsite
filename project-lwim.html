            <br>
            <p>Look What I've made is a metroidvania/RPG game in which <br> you'll have to escape from an underground prision by 
                recovering <br>all your abilities and defeating challenging places and enemies.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> In the game, you can choose between two characters,<br> two different ways to approach the escape. <br>Upgrade your skills as you want
                and make the perfect build for your character.

            <h1>My contribution</h1>
            <p><br>In this project I've worked as a game programmer even though <br> 
                I ended doing shaders and particles as it was a small team.<br> 
                <br>The main features I've worked on were; enemies behaviour, meaning combat, health and AI,<br>
                and the player movement and some player attacks. <br>
                <br>It was my first big project and thanks to it I learned a lot about Unity engine<br>
                 and improved my game programming skills.
