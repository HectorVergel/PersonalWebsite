                        As a person highly interested in programming, the field of game programming has become <br> a passion for me. I
                        enjoy learning new things every day and being updated. Because of that, I like to participate in any kind of projects
                        related to game development and also I have fun creating my own games.<br>
                        My strongest transversal skills would be team-working and problem-solving. I like to be involved in team projects
                        and keep improving these skills.
